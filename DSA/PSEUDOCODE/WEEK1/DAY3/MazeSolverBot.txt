Given maze as 2D grid with:
    0 = path
    1 = wall
    S = start, E = exit

Function solveMaze(x, y):
    If (x,y) is exit → print "Solved" and return true
    If (x,y) is invalid or already visited → return false
    Mark (x,y) as visited
    Try moving up, down, left, right recursively
    If any move returns true → return true
    Backtrack (unmark visited) and return false

In main:
    Call solveMaze(startX, startY)
    Print path if found
