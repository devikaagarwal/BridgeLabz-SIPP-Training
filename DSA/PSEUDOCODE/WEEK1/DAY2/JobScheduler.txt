Define Job class:
    Attributes: id, deadline, processingTime

Use PriorityQueue with custom comparator:
    Order jobs by earliest deadline, then by shortest processingTime

Function scheduleJobs():
    While queue not empty:
        Remove job with highest priority
        Print "Executing job with id ..."

In main:
    Insert jobs into priority queue
    Call scheduleJobs()
